## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Stateles, please report it via the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/dotnet-state-machine/stateless/security/advisories) page. Creating a security advistory will notify the project owners and allow them to assess it and take appropriate action to resolve it.
